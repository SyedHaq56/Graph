      <p style="border:15px; border-style:solid; border-color:white; padding: 2em;">Cecil Brooks Jr. community board 1 member, and the Chair for The Bronx committee at Transportation Alternatives, said that there were no plans for installing
        citi-bikes in The Bronx until the end of 2020 and early 2021 before the pandemic arrived. "With the essential workers, people working in the hospitals and needing another way to get around outside of the subway. There were stations put
        [around] Lincoln Hospital in our community board," said Brooks Jr.

        Incomplete biking infrastructure throughout the borough, plus, reckless driving on major roads is what contributed to the increase in these crashes according to Brooks Jr.

        He says the solution to the problem is having protected bike-lanes, wide green lanes that do not permit a car to be parked anywhere close to it.

        "A lot of cars [are] parked in those bike lanes," said Brooks Jr. "If it's only a bunch of paint, there's nothing stopping someone from taking space."
